A small framework around pygame to allow me to more easily display algorithms.

To use it, add it as a subfolder to a project called `Algorithms`, and add any algorithm in a different subfolder along with a `run.py` file that uses a `Runner()` to call the framework. See `TravellingSalesman/run.py` as an example.
